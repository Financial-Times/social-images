# Social images

A set of social media icons. These are coloured with the logo colour of the social network.

## Usage

As with all image sets, these are available via the [Image Service](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2).

To get an image from the image service, use the following URL (replace the `product_source` with your product name and `icon_name` with the icon you want)

`https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftsocial:{icon_name}?source={product_source}`

So to get a twitter icon:
`https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftsocial:twitter?source=test`


### Getting these icons in a different colour/format/size

The Image Service will convert these images on the fly if you pass in the right parameters. To find out more about this, please see the [Image Service documentation](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/docs/api)
